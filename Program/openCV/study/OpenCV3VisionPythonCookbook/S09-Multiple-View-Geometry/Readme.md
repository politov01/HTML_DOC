# Multiple View Geometry
## This chapter covers the following recipes:

* Pinhole camera model calibration 
* Fisheye camera model calibration 
* Stereo rig calibration - estimation of extrinsics 
* Distorting and undistorting points 
* Removing lens distortion effects from an image 
* Restoring a 3D point from two observations through triangulation 
* Finding a relative camera-object pose through the PnP algorithm 
* Aligning two views through stereo rectification 
* Epipolar geometry - computing fundamental and essential matrices 
* Essential matrix decomposition into rotation and translation 
* Estimating disparity maps for stereo images 
* Special case 2-view geometry - estimating homography transformation 
* Planar scene - decomposing homography into rotation and translation 
* Rotational camera cas - estimating camera rotation from homography
