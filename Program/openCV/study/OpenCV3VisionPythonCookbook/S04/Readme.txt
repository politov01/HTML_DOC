Object Detection and Machine Learning

In this chapter, we will cover the following recipes:

Obtaining an object mask using the GrabCut algorithm 
Finding edges using the Canny algorithm 
Detecting lines and circles using the Hough transform
Finding objects via template matching 
The real-time median-flow object tracker 
Tracking objects using different algorithms via the tracking API 
Computing the dense optical flow between two frames 
Detecting chessboard and circle grid patterns 
A simple pedestrian detector using the SVM model 
Optical character recognition using different machine learning models 
Detecting faces using Haar/LBP cascades 
Detecting AruCo patterns for AR applications 
Detecting text in natural scenes 
The QR code detector and recognizer
