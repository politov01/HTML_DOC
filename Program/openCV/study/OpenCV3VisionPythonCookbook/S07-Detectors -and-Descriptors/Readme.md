# Detectors and Descriptors
 
This chapter contains recipes for:

* Finding corners in an image - Harris and FAST 
* Selecting good corners in an image for tracking 
* Drawing keypoints, descriptors, and matches 
* Detecting scale invariant keypoints 
* Computing descriptors for image keypoints - SURF, BRIEF, and ORB 
* Matching techniques for finding correspondences between descriptors 
* Finding reliable matches - cross-check and ratio test 
* Model-based filtering of matches - RANSAC 
* BoW model for constructing global image descriptors
