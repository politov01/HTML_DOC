    "# Getting input and output tensors' shapes for all layers\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it's necessary to get information about what's going on with the data shape during a forward pass in deep neural networks. For example, some models allow the usage of various input spatial size and, in that case, you may want to know the output tensors' shapes. OpenCV has an option to get all shapes for all tensors (including intermediate tensors) without inference. This recipe reviews ways of using such functionality along with other useful routines relevant to neural nets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `getLayersShapes` function of the `Net` class from the `cv2.dnn` module computes all tensor shapes. It accepts shape as input, a list of four integers. The elements in the list are the number of examples, number of channels, width, and height of the input tensor. The function returns a tuple of three elements: a list of layer identifiers in the model, a list of input tensor shapes for each layer, and a list of output tensor shapes also for each layer. The list of layer identifiers is necessary when we want to get some additional information about the layers, because some functions of `cv2.dnn_Net` accept identifiers from this list. Returned lists for the input and output shapes contain all the shapes for all of the outputs of the layers. Since each layer can have several inputs and outputs, these returned lists contain lists of NumPy integer arrays of length `4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we've used some other functions in the previous code. Let's discuss them too. The `empty` function of `cv2.dnn_Net` returns `True` if the network doesn't contain any layers; it can be used to check whether the model was loaded or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `getLayerTypes` function returns all layer types that are used in the model. This information can help you to get a basic idea about the model. The `getLayersCount` function gets the layer type and returns a number of layers with specified type. The `getLayerNames` function gives you all of the names for the layers in the model. Basically, neural net models contain names for the layers and they are preserved during loading and parsing. These names are returned by the `getLayerNames` function.\n",
