Deep Learning

This chapter contains recipes for:

* Representing images as tensors/blobs 
* Loading Deep Learning models from Caffe, Torch, and TensorFlow formats 
* Getting input and output tensors' shapes for all layers 
* Preprocessing images and inference in convolutional networks 
* Measuring inference time and contributions to it from each layer 
* Classifying images with GoogleNet/Inception and ResNet models 
* Detecting objects with the Single Shot Detection (SSD) model 
* Segmenting a scene using the Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) model 
* Face detection using Single Shot Detection (SSD) and the ResNet model 
* Prediction age and gender
