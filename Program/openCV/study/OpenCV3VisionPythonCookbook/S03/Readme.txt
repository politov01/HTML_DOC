Contours and Segmentation
In this chapter, we will cover the following recipes:

Binarization of grayscale images using the Otsu algorithm 
Finding external and internal contours in a binary image 
Extracting connected components from a binary image 
Fitting lines and circles into two-dimensional point sets 
Calculating image moments .
Working with curves - approximation, length, and area .
Checking whether a point is within a contour 
Computing the distance to a two-dimensional point set from every pixel 
Image segmentation using the k-means algorithm 
Image segmentation using segment seeds, the watershed algorithm
